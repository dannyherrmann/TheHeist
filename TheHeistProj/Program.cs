// ### Phase Three
//
// The program should be updated to...
//
// 1. Stop displaying each team member's information.

// 2. Store a value for the *bank's difficulty level*. Set this value to 100.

// 3. Sum the skill levels of the team. Save that number.

// 4. Compare the number with the bank's difficulty level. If the team's
//     skill level is greater than or equal to the bank's difficulty level,
//     Display a success message, otherwise display a failure message.
